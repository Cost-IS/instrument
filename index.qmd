# About
Cost-IS is an instrument for costing implementation strategies in the healthcare setting. 

Cost-IS's aim and scope is to collect data on the costs associated with implementation strategies for healthcare interventions. The instrument provides a pragmatic and flexible approach that can be tailored to meet the needs of various projects. 

Reliable implementation cost estimations produced from this standardised tool will inform appropriate resourcing for implementation strategies resulting in a greater likelihood of implementation success. As well as providing decision makers with reliable information from economic evaluations of health care innovations that account for the full extent of costs. It is anticipated that the transdisciplinary nature of Cost-IS will contribute to an expanded knowledge of implementation costs through improved collaboration between implementation scientists and health economists. Further piloting of Cost-IS is required for validation.

### Cost-IS Templates

Cost-IS comprises of three data collection templates: template 1, 2, and 3.

**[Downloadable Cost-IS templates](https://github.com/Thomasina-Donovan/implementation-costing-instrument/raw/main/assets/Cost-IS_TemplatesBlank_V4.xlsx)**

### Template 1: Planning 

The purpose of template 1 is to help identify specific data items that need to be collected. This will allow for comprehensive and targeted data collection later in the costing instrument. 

A project's implementation strategies are listed under the first column. For each strategy, the activities and resources (labour and non-labour) required to operationalise the strategy are listed under the relevant columns.

### Template 2: Data collection

Template 2 is used to collect the data necessary to quantify the cost of resources associated with the implementation strategies.

The level of detail to include depends on the project. We found that the listed columns in the template provided sufficient granularity for the subsequent analysis. The template is flexible and can be adjusted to meet the needs of your project, by altering the columns and their content. 

### Template 3: Resource valuation

Template 3 enables the valuation of the identified resources. This is a separate template for clarity and ease of update. Template 3 informs Template 2’s columns ‘hourly wage rate’ and ‘resource- category’.

### Analysis

Cost-IS is a data collection tool. Subsequent analysis from the data collected in the completed templates should be conducted in a meaningful way to the project as determined by the analyst. The templates were designed to collect data at varying levels of detail because of the wide range of implementation projects. 



# Worked example

A worked example of Cost-IS is provided below which may assist future users of Cost-IS. An additional user guide was produced as a result of applying Cost-IS to three real-world implementation projects as case studies (*manuscript coming soon*). The completed Cost-IS templates from the collective case study are provided as another example that may assist future users.

### Worked example explained by template

::: {.nav-pills}
::: {.panel-tabset}

## Template 1

The worked example of template 1 includes four implementation strategies with associated activities and resources. Both labour and non-labour resources are included under the corresponding column and respective strategy.

## Template 2
In template 2 the entries columns ‘Activity’, ‘Strategy’ and ‘Role’ are restricted by drop down menus containing what was listed in template 1. Template 1 can be completed iteratively as required by the project.

In the worked example of template 2A, all activities associated with the hypothetical implementation were recorded. The date, site and phase for each activity is recorded under the corresponding columns. Similarly, a purpose was recorded for each activity to distinguish it from other similar activities. The implementation strategy related to the respective activity was documented in the same row. 

The cost is automatically calculated under the respective column when the resource, number of resource, and time spent by resource is completed. See below for how labour and non-labour resources were recorded.

The source where this data was collected from is recorded in the final column.

### labour resource
Project roles involved in the activity are documented under the 'resource' column. The resource category is taken by the information provided in Template 3. Unique project roles are recorded on a separate row and the activity is repeated. For each activity, the number of personnel and the time spent (in hours) for each project role was recorded under the corresponding column. The resource is described as labour under the corresponding column.

### non-labour resource
The worked example contains two non-labour resources used in the hypothetical implementation. The activity associated with non-labour resources are recorded in Template 2 in a similar manner as described above. The unit price is taken from information provided in Template 3. The number of units per resource is recorded under 'number of personnel involved'. The resource is described as non-labour under the corresponding column.

## Template 3
Each unique resource is listed in Template 3. The entries in column 'resource’ is restricted by a drop down menu containing what was listed in template 1. Template 1 can be completed iteratively as required by the project.

### labour resource
Labour resources are listed as project roles. A resource category relevant to the project is applied to each role for granular analysis. The role's position/ tile and annual salary is provided in the following columns. The hourly cost and hourly plus oncosts is automatically calcualted in the next columns. Adapt the number of hours and oncosts as required to your project.

### non-labour resource
The worked example contains two non-labour resources used in the hypothetical implementation. Non-labour resources are listed in the bottom section of Template 3. A resource category is still applied to non-labour resources. In the next column, the resource is listed as a monetary or opportunity cost type. The source, cost year, and unit price are supplied in the following columns.

## Analysis example

The worked example demonstrates how implementation costs can be summarised by resource and implementation strategy. An example of how implementation cost findings may be presented are below.

# Development

##### Cost-IS was developed iteratively across four phases. 

* Phase 1 involved a systematic literature review to identify the nature of implementation costs and the methods used to measure and value these costs, within the context of hospital-based clinical decision support systems initiatives. 

* Phase 2 consisted of qualitative semi-structured interviews that outlined current practices for capturing the costs associated with implementing digital health initiatives in hospital settings. 

* Phase 3 development involved a modified electronic-Delphi (e-Delphi) process to generate a consensus on the core components and design of an implementation costing instrument. 

* In Phase 4 the developed Cost-IS was applied to three real-world implementation projects in a collective case study.

## Phase 1 findings
### Systematic review
A prototype of the implementation costing instrument was first developed from findings from a literature review and qualitative interviews. It was observed in the literature review that there was considerable inconsistency and ambiguity in methods used to cost digital health implementation strategies. However, labour was consistently reported to be the largest implementation-related cost. This was consistent with the views expressed during our prior qualitative interview study with stakeholders which indicated that staff time tracking was a commonly used approach to cost implementation. As a result, the initial prototype included an activity log and a template to capture labour. Other implementation-related costs reported in the literature included consumables, durable assets, and physical space. A separate template was included in the prototype to capture these costs. 

## Phase 2 findings
### Qualitative interviews
The interview findings demonstrated that costing implementation was hindered by the perceived ill-defined boundaries of what constitutes implementation strategies and inconsistencies in terminology used across the disciplines of implementation science, health economics and digital health. The prototype therefore included a planning template to assist users in identifying implementation costs to allow for appropriate data collection. Appendices were included in the prototype with explanatory reference text for users on what could constitute potential implementation costs to assist them in completing the planning template. The resulting prototype was used as stimulus material in the first round of the e-Delphi.

## Phase 3 findings
### Modified e-Delphi process
Consensus was reached on the core components and design of the instrument from a panel of twelve experts in implementation science, health economic evaluations and/or digital health. Areas of non-consensus included the user’s level of implementation science knowledge, specificity to digital health and accessibility via digital formats.

## Phase 4 findings
### Collective case study
Cost-IS was found to be a flexible instrument that can be tailored to meet the requirements of a range of implementation projects. The Cost-IS instrument enabled comparisons of cost estimates of implementation strategies between three real-world implementation case studies. Labour was the majority of implementation costs. Implementation cost findings provided value for reporting or evaluating, should be customised to project context, and include contextual and analysis information. Adaptions to Cost-IS during the costing process included improved data capture granularity, meaningful categorisation, and enhanced flexibility for analysis.

## Future development

Cost-IS requires further validation including applying Cost-IS from the beginning of new projects to guide prospective collection of implementation costs. Prospective data collection may allow more comprehensive and accurate data to be collected throughout the project and may reduce the reliance on informed assumptions and recall. 

Investigation into incorporating contextual information with implementation cost estimates will improve Cost-IS and was a suggestion from Phase 4. The inclusion of contextual information will improve transparency of implementation cost estimates.


# Resource

Below is a list of resources that I find helpful when costing implementation.

## Implementation Science Costing Guidebook

The Dissemination & Implementation Science Program team at University of Colorado have developed a useful Costing Guidebook for Implementation Scientists. This resource is free for use and is intended for Implementation Scientists who are attempting to conduct a cost assessment on their own projects.

[Implementation Science Costing Guidebook](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/accords/cores-and-programs/dissemination-implementation-science-program/implementation-science-costing-guidebook)


## Costing implementation seminar

The Implementation Science Academy at the Sydney Health Partners have several implementation science resources including seminars. In Oct 2024, Dr Marina Pinheiro delivered a helpful seminar on economic evaluations alongside implementation studies. This seminar provides a great explanation of key concepts and common barriers to conducting costing studies alongside implementation studies. 

Please note only members can access the seminar, but membership is free.
