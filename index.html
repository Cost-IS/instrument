<p>The purpose of template 1 is to help identify specific data items that need to be collected. This will allow for comprehensive and targeted data collection later in the costing instrument.</p>
<p>A project’s implementation strategies are listed under the first column. For each strategy, the activities and resources (labour and non-labour) required to operationalise the strategy are listed under the relevant columns.</p>

<p>Template 2 is used to collect the data necessary to quantify the cost of resources associated with the implementation strategies.</p>
<p>The level of detail to include depends on the project. We found that the listed columns in the template provided sufficient granularity for the subsequent analysis. The template is flexible and can be adjusted to meet the needs of your project, by altering the columns and their content.</p>

<p>Cost-IS’s aim and scope is to collect data on the costs associated with implementation strategies for healthcare interventions. The instrument provides a pragmatic and flexible approach that can be tailored to meet the needs of various projects.</p>
<p>Reliable implementation cost estimations produced from this standardised tool will inform appropriate resourcing for implementation strategies resulting in a greater likelihood of implementation success. As well as providing decision makers with reliable information from economic evaluations of health care innovations that account for the full extent of costs. It is anticipated that the transdisciplinary nature of Cost-IS will contribute to an expanded knowledge of implementation costs through improved collaboration between implementation scientists and health economists. Further piloting of Cost-IS is required for validation.</p>

<p>Cost-IS is a data collection tool. Subsequent analysis from the data collected in the completed templates should be conducted in a meaningful way to the project as determined by the analyst. The templates were designed to collect data at varying levels of detail because of the wide range of implementation projects.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="systematic-review">Systematic review</h3>
<p>A prototype of the implementation costing instrument was first developed from findings from a literature review and qualitative interviews. It was observed in the literature review that there was considerable inconsistency and ambiguity in methods used to cost digital health implementation strategies. However, labour was consistently reported to be the largest implementation-related cost. This was consistent with the views expressed during our prior qualitative interview study with stakeholders which indicated that staff time tracking was a commonly used approach to cost implementation. As a result, the initial prototype included an activity log and a template to capture labour. Other implementation-related costs reported in the literature included consumables, durable assets, and physical space. A separate template was included in the prototype to capture these costs.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qualitative-interviews">Qualitative interviews</h3>
<p>The interview findings demonstrated that costing implementation was hindered by the perceived ill-defined boundaries of what constitutes implementation strategies and inconsistencies in terminology used across the disciplines of implementation science, health economics and digital health. The prototype therefore included a planning template to assist users in identifying implementation costs to allow for appropriate data collection. Appendices were included in the prototype with explanatory reference text for users on what could constitute potential implementation costs to assist them in completing the planning template. The resulting prototype was used as stimulus material in the first round of the e-Delphi.</p>

<p>Cost-IS was found to be a flexible instrument that can be tailored to meet the requirements of a range of implementation projects. The Cost-IS instrument enabled comparisons of cost estimates of implementation strategies between three real-world implementation case studies. Labour was the majority of implementation costs. Implementation cost findings provided value for reporting or evaluating, should be customised to project context, and include contextual and analysis information. Adaptions to Cost-IS during the costing process included improved data capture granularity, meaningful categorisation, and enhanced flexibility for analysis.</p>

<p>Cost-IS requires further validation including applying Cost-IS from the beginning of new projects to guide prospective collection of implementation costs. Prospective data collection may allow more comprehensive and accurate data to be collected throughout the project and may reduce the reliance on informed assumptions and recall.</p>
<p>Investigation into incorporating contextual information with implementation cost estimates will improve Cost-IS and was a suggestion from Phase 4. The inclusion of contextual information will improve transparency of implementation cost estimates.</p>
